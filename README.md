This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Readable
---

## Project Purpose:

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the flow and operation of an application built on React and Redux.

## Install
The project uses Node.js and the create-react-app starter.

### Api Server
This project uses an api as a server that was taken from the initial repository of the Udacity project.
```
cd api-server
yarn install
node server
```

## Install Readable
Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app
```
git@github.com:ricardodecarvalho/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git
cd reactnd-project-readable-starter
yarn install
```
Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with
```
yarn start
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser

## How to Use the App
* Number of categories was limited in three: React, Redux and Udacity;
* Initially two posts are listed;
* Each user can create as many posts as he wants, in any category;
* User can also create comments within each post;
* You can also edit, delete and vote in both post and comments;
* Update and ordering features of lists by date and vote are also available.

*Note: All records entered in the forms are stored in the localStorage and are lost every time the server is restarted or a new browser session is opened.*
